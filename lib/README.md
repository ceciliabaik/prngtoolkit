# Installation

To use the PRNG Toolkit in your Java project, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository:

Open your command-line terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to store the toolkit, then run the following command:
**git clone https://github.com/yourusername/prngtoolkit.git**

2. Choose a Programming Environment:

Depending on the programming language used to develop the toolkit, you should have a compatible development environment set up. For example, if it's a Java library, make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.

3. Integrate the PRNG Toolkit:

Java: If it's a Java library, you can typically include it in your project using a build automation tool like Maven or Gradle. Modify your project's build file (pom.xml for Maven or build.gradle for Gradle) to include the toolkit as a dependency.

<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.example</groupId>
        <artifactId>prng-toolkit</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.0</version> <!-- Replace with the actual version -->
    </dependency>
</dependencies>

4. Use the Toolkit:

Once the toolkit is integrated into your project, you can start using its functions and classes according to its documentation. Typically, you would import the necessary classes and call their methods in your code.

For Java, it might look like this:
